Here's a **detailed and descriptive draft** for changing the source repository of an application hosted on **AWS Amplify**. This draft includes every step, expected actions, and tips to ensure a smooth transition.

# **Detailed Steps to Change Source Repository in AWS Amplify**

If your AWS Amplify-hosted application needs to be connected to a different repository, follow these detailed steps to **disconnect the existing repository** and reconnect a new one. Amplify does not currently allow "changing" the repository directly, so this involves reconnecting the app to a new repository.

---

## **Step 1: Prepare the New Repository**

Before making changes to AWS Amplify, prepare the new repository:

1. **Set Up the Code in the New Repository**:
   - Create a new GitHub repository (or use an existing one).
   - Push your application code to the repository.  
   Example:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit for Amplify app"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<new-repo>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Verify the Branch**:
   - Ensure the correct branch exists (`main`, `master`, `develop`, etc.) in the new repository.

3. **Test the Code Locally**:
   - Run the code locally to confirm it works and all build configurations are correct.

4. **Review Build Specifications**:
   - If you are using a custom `amplify.yml` file for build settings, include it in the root directory of the new repository.

---

## **Step 2: Disconnect the Existing Repository in AWS Amplify**

1. **Access the AWS Amplify Console**:
   - Log in to the **AWS Management Console**.
   - Open the **Amplify Console** by searching for “Amplify” in the AWS search bar.

2. **Open Your Application**:
   - From the list of apps, select the application whose repository you want to change.

3. **Disconnect the Existing Repository**:
   - Navigate to **App settings** > **General settings**.
   - You will see details of the currently connected repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.).
   - Since Amplify does not have a "Change repository" option directly, you will need to **delete the app configuration**:
     - Scroll down to **Delete app**.
     - Confirm the deletion by typing "delete" in the confirmation dialog.

**⚠ Note**: Deleting the app configuration will not delete your source code or repository. However, deployment settings will need to be reconfigured.

---

## **Step 3: Connect the New Repository**

After disconnecting the old repository, follow these steps to connect the new repository:

1. **Create a New Amplify App**:
   - From the Amplify Console main page, click **Create new app**.
   - Select **Host web app**.

2. **Select GitHub as the Source Provider**:
   - Choose **GitHub** as your repository provider.
   - If this is your first time using GitHub with Amplify, you will need to install and authorize the **Amplify GitHub App**.

   **Steps to Authorize**:
   - Click **Authorize AWS Amplify** when prompted.
   - Install the Amplify GitHub App and grant access to your **new repository**.
   - The link for manual installation is typically:  
     ```
     https://github.com/apps/aws-amplify-<region>/installations/new
     ```
     Replace `<region>` with your deployment region.

3. **Select the New Repository and Branch**:
   - After authorization, Amplify will display a list of your GitHub repositories.
   - Choose the **new repository** and the branch you wish to connect (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
   - Click **Next**.

## **Step 4: Review and Configure Build Settings**

AWS Amplify will attempt to auto-detect the build settings for your project. Follow these steps to confirm or customize them:

1. **Build Settings Detection**:
   - Amplify will analyze your project (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) and suggest default build settings.
   - Review the default configuration or edit it as needed.

2. **Example Build Specification** (React):
   If your project uses React, your build settings (`amplify.yml`) might look like this:

   ```yaml
   version: 1
   frontend:
     phases:
       preBuild:
         commands:
           - npm install
       build:
         commands:
           - npm run build
     artifacts:
       baseDirectory: build
       files:
         - '**/*'
     cache:
       paths:
         - node_modules/**/*
   ```

3. **Save Build Configuration**:
   - Review the configuration and confirm.
   - If you use a custom `amplify.yml` file, ensure it is stored in the root of your repository.

---

## **Step 5: Deploy the Application**

1. **Review the App Configuration**:
   - On the "Review" page, verify:
     - Repository name and branch.
     - Build settings.
   - Click **Save and Deploy**.

2. **Monitor the Build Process**:
   - Amplify will start building the application using the code from your new repository.
   - You can monitor progress on the **Builds** page.

3. **Verify the Deployment**:
   - Once the build completes, Amplify will provide a URL to access the deployed application.
   - Test the application to ensure all features are working correctly.

---

## **Step 6: Configure Environment Variables (If Required)**

If your application uses environment variables:

1. Go to **App settings** > **Environment variables**.
2. Add any environment variables required by the new repository.
   - For example:
     ```text
     API_URL=https://api.example.com
     NODE_ENV=production
     ```
3. Click **Save** and trigger a **Redeploy** to apply the changes.

---

## **Step 7: Clean Up (Optional)**

- If the old repository or deployment is no longer needed, clean up by:
  1. Removing the Amplify App configurations related to the old repository.
  2. Deleting unused IAM roles, S3 buckets, or CloudFront distributions created by the previous app.

---

## **Troubleshooting Tips**

1. **Repository Not Showing Up**:
   - Ensure the Amplify GitHub App has access to the new repository.
   - Reauthorize the GitHub App if necessary.

2. **Build Fails**:
   - Check the build logs in Amplify Console for errors.
   - Verify your new repository contains all required files (`package.json`, `amplify.yml`, etc.).

3. **Environment Variables Missing**:
   - Re-add all necessary environment variables in Amplify Console.

4. **Custom Domains**:
   - If you had a custom domain configured, reconnect it under **App settings → Custom domains**.

---

## **Final Notes**

By following this step-by-step process, you will effectively change the source repository for your AWS Amplify application. Although Amplify does not directly support "changing" repositories, the process of reconnecting ensures your app can be hosted seamlessly with the new repository.
